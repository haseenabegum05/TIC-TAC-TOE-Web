Project Description:
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game project is a classic and timeless implementation of the popular two-player board game. It allows users to play the game on a computer or mobile device against another human player or an AI opponent. This project provides a simple yet entertaining way for users to enjoy the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Key Features:

Game Board: The project includes a 3x3 grid where players can make their moves.

Player Options: Players can choose to play against another human locally or against a computer AI opponent.

AI Difficulty Levels: For games against the AI, players can often select from different difficulty levels, such as easy, medium, or hard, depending on the sophistication of the AI algorithm used.

Winning Conditions: The game checks for winning conditions, such as a player getting three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and declares the winner.

User Interface: The project offers a user-friendly interface with clear instructions, buttons for making moves, and a display of the current game state.

Game Logic: The core game logic ensures that players can only make valid moves and that the game proceeds in a fair and accurate manner.

Game Over Detection: It detects when the game is over, whether due to a win, a draw, or a player's decision to quit.

Score Keeping: In multiplayer mode, the project may keep track of the score between two players.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
User Interface Framework (e.g., HTML/CSS for web-based versions)
AI Algorithm (if implementing AI opponents)
Data Structures (for managing the game board)
User Input Handling
Project Goals:
The primary goal of this project is to provide a fun and interactive implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, offering players the option to challenge their friends or enjoy a game against an AI opponent. It can serve as a beginner-level programming project to practice coding, user interface design, and logic implementation.

Potential Extensions:

Implementing more advanced AI algorithms for a stronger computer opponent.
Adding a graphical interface for a more visually appealing game.
Expanding the game to allow for larger board sizes or different variations of Tic-Tac-Toe.
